# Google Sheets SiS
 Streamlit In Snowflake Google Sheets Connector

 This repo contains a sample project that implements a [Streamlit in Snowflake](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/developer-guide/streamlit/about-streamlit) App that uses [External Access](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/developer-guide/external-network-access/creating-using-external-network-access) to ingest data from Google Sheets to a Snowflake table.
 
 Please follow the steps below to install the connnector in your Snowflake Account.

 **Step 1.** Configure the settings.yml file with values that represent your environment. I would recommend starting by filtering on a single dbt project and or Snowflake database.
